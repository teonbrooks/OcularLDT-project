"""
Creating Event files

EM data are in a trial structure while MEG data are continuous. In order to
begin looking at these two data streams, we need to co-register in a common
reference frame.
Here, we're creating two files for all of the MEG analyses:

01. An event file with all the fixation crosses, primes, and targets.
02. A co-registering event file to match EM data for fix, prime, target regions.

        --------------------------------------
        The MEG and EM files must be aligned to have a proper decoding.
        This arranges the triggers in events of interests: prime, target.
        These events are consistent and identifable in both data types.
