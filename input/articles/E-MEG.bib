	Abstract = {The spatio-temporal dipole model approach has been used to identify the difference dipoles arising from changes in the ocular dipoles due to eye movements and blinks. Based on these results a method has been developed to remove eye artefacts from electrical or magnetic data. The method avoids distortions due to the head model by determining the spatial distribution of the signals from the eyes empirically. Using simultaneous modelling of the EEG or MEG activity with dipole sources distributed within the head together with the empirically determined spatial eye components, the eye activity can be estimated and removed from the EEG or MEG. This greatly reduces the distortion to the topography that is a concomitant of previous eye artefact correction methods. The advantages of the method are illustrated using simulated and real electrical data.},

	Abstract = {Average EOGs were recorded from 4 subjects for vertical and horizontal eye movements of 15 degrees away from and back to a central fixation point, and for eyeblinks while looking at the fixation point. Using spatio-temporal dipole modelling, several alternative dipole models of the electrical activity of the eyes were compared. A reasonable fit was only obtained if the equivalent dipoles were allowed to take up different locations and orientations depending on the type of eye activity. It appears that (a) the equivalent ocular dipole is located away from the axis of rotation of the eyeball, (b) eyelid movements contribute to a change in location of the dipole in vertical eye movements and blinks, and (c) some of the apparent dipole movement is due to inadequacy of the 3-shell spherical head model near to the eyes. Consequences of the results for eye-artifact correction are discussed.},

@article{Berg:1994,
	Abstract = {Previously published methods correct eye artifacts by subtracting proportions of the EOG from EEG electrodes. The implicit assumption made by these methods is that the EOG signals are a good measure of eye activity and contain no EEG. In this paper a new multiple source eye correction (MSEC) method of eye artifact treatment based on multiple source analysis is presented, which incorporates a model of brain activity. An accurate, head model-independent estimate of the spatial distribution of eye activity can be obtained empirically from calibration data containing systematic eye movements and blinks. Using the resulting spatial vectors together with the brain model, eye activity in EEG and event-related response data can be estimated in the presence of overlapping brain activity and corrected. A consequence of the MSEC approach is that data at EOG electrodes can be included in analyses of brain activity. In addition, by suitable selection of the spatial vectors, the eye activity can be split into signals which identify vertical and horizontal movements and eyeblinks.

Using auditory ERP data sets with and without large eye artifacts, the MSEC method is compared with a ``traditional'' method in which brain activity is not modelled, particularly with respect to the spatial distribution of the corrected EEG. Traditional eye correction methods are shown to alter the spatial distribution of the EEG, resulting, for example, in changes in location and orientation of modelled equivalent sources. Such distortion is much reduced in the MSEC method, thus enhancing the precision of topographical EEG analyses.},

@article{Matsumoto:2005,
	Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the neural substrates involved in semantic priming using a combined event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) study. Twelve subjects were instructed to judge whether the presented target word was a real word or a nonword. Under the related condition, target words were preceded by a semantically related prime word. On the other hand, under the unrelated condition, prime words did not have semantic relatedness with the target word. The reaction time for reaching a judgment was longer under the unrelated condition than under the related condition, indicating that the recognition of target words is promoted by semantic priming under the related condition. In the fMRI results, we found reduced activity in the dorsal and ventral left inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate, and left superior temporal cortex for related versus unrelated conditions (i.e., the repetition suppression effect). ERP analysis revealed that the amplitude of the N400 component was reduced under the related condition compared with the unrelated condition (i.e., the N400 priming effect). Correlation analysis between the BOLD repetition suppression effect and the N400 priming effect decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) across subjects showed significant correlation in the left superior temporal gyrus. This finding is consistent with the recent MEG data suggesting that the source of N400 is judged to be the bilateral superior temporal lobe. We discussed this finding herein in relation to the modulation of access to the phonological representation caused by semantic priming.},

	Abstract = {Several authors have contended that the N400 is a reflection of a post-lexical event such as that proposed by Neely and Keefe [J.H. Neely, D.E. Keefe, Semantic context effects on visual word processing: a hybrid prospective/retrospective processing theory, in: G.H. Bower (Ed.), The Psychology of Learning and Motivation: Advances in Research and Theory, Vol. 23, Academic Press, New York, 1989, pp. 207-248.], whereby the subject compares the word on the current trial to the "context" provided by the word on the preceding trial [M. Besson, M. Kutas, The many facets of repetition: A cued-recall and event-related potential analysis of repeating words in same versus different sentence contexts, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, 19 (5) (1993), 1115-1133; C. Brown, P. Hagoort, The processing nature of the N400: Evidence from masked priming. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 5(1) (1993), 34-44; P.J. Holcomb, Semantic priming and stimulus degradation: Implications for the role of the N400 in language processing, Psychophysiology 30 (1993), 47-61; M.D. Rugg, M.C. Doyle, Event-related potentials and stimulus repetition in indirect and direct tests of memory, in: H. Heinze, T. Munte, G.R. Mangun (Eds), Cognitive Electrophysiology, Birkhauser Boston, Cambridge, MA, 1994]. A study which used masked primes to directly test this possibility has been reported by Brown and Hagoort [C. Brown, P. Hagoort, The processing nature of the N400: evidence from masked priming. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 5(1) (1993), 34-44]. When the primes were masked, no priming effect was observed on the N400. When behavioral data were collected in the same paradigm, from another group of subjects, the usual priming effect on RT was obtained. Considered together, the data from the two groups of subjects indicated that activation of semantic representations had occurred without conscious awareness. As no N400 priming effect was observed, it was suggested that N400 must reflect a post-lexical process. This interpretation, however, is at odds with the findings of other studies which have reported N400 priming effects under conditions where post-lexical processes would not be thought to operate[J. Anderson, P. Holcomb, Auditory and visual semantic priming using different stimulus onset asynchronies: an event-related brain potential study. Psychophysiology 32 (1995), 177-190; J. Boddy, Event-related potentials in chronometric analysis of primed word recognition with different stimulus onset asynchronies, Psychophysiology 23 (1986), 232-245; D. Deacon, T. Uhm, W. Ritter, S. Hewitt, The lifetime of automatic priming effects may exceed two seconds, Cognitive Brain Research 7 (1999), 465-472; P.J. Holcomb, Automatic and attentional process: an event-related brain potential analysis of semantic priming. Brain and Language 35 (1998) 66-85]. The present study replicated Brown and Hagoort using a repeated measures design, a shorter SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony), and a slightly different threshold setting procedure. Significant priming effects were obtained on the mean amplitude of the N400 regardless of whether the words were masked or unmasked. The findings imply that the processing subserving the N400 is not postlexical, since the N400 was manipulated without the subjects being aware of the identity of the words.},

	Abstract = {ERPs were recorded during a lexical decision task in order to investigate electrophysiological concomitants of semantic priming. The stimuli were 240 words and 240 nonwords presented one per trial at a fixed intertrial interval. Subjects were required to classify each stimulus as a word or nonword by pressing one of two response buttons. ERPs were recorded from 14 scalp locations, the right suborbital ridge, and the left earlobe, all referred to a balanced non-cephalic reference. RT and error data confirmed that semantic priming occurred under the conditions employed: primed words (those preceded by a semantically related word) were identified as words faster and more accurately than were unprimed words (those preceded by semantically unrelated words or nonwords). ERPs for all stimulus types were characterized by a large positivity peaking between 550 and 650 msec, preceded by a negative-going deflection peaking at approximately 400 msec. ERPs for primed and unprimed words were shown to differ significantly, diverging 200-250 msec following stimulus onset, reaching a maximum near the peak of the negative-going deflection at 400 msec. These differences were observed at locations over both hemispheres and were maximal in the centroparietal region. Although P300 latency differences between primed and unprimed words were also obtained, the priming effect on ERPs at shorter latencies could not be explained solely by P300 latency effects. Possible relationships between these ERP concomitants of semantic priming and P300, N200, and N400 were discussed.},

@article{Kutas:1984,
	Abstract = {The neuroelectric activity of the human brain that accompanies linguistic processing can be studied through recordings of event-related potentials (e.r.p. components) from the scalp. The e.r.ps triggered by verbal stimuli have been related to several different aspects of language processing. For example, the N400 component, peaking around 400 ms post-stimulus, appears to be a sensitive indicator of the semantic relationship between a word and the context in which it occurs. Words that complete sentences in a nonsensical fashion elicit much larger N400 waves than do semantically appropriate words or non-semantic irregularities in a text. In the present study, e.r.ps were recorded in response to words that completed meaningful sentences. The amplitude of the N400 component of the e.r.p. was found to be an inverse function of the subject's expectancy for the terminal word as measured by its 'Cloze probability'. In addition, unexpected words that were semantically related to highly expected words elicited lower N400 amplitudes. These findings suggest N400 may reflect processes of semantic priming or activation.},

The major emphasis of the review is on reading as a specific example of cognitive processing. Basic topics discussed with respect to reading are (a) the characteristics of eye movements, (b) the perceptual span, (c) integration of information across saccades, (d) eye movement control, and (e) individual differences (including dyslexia). Similar topics are discussed with respect to the other tasks examined. The basic theme of the review is that eye movement data reflect moment-to-moment cognitive processes in the various tasks examined. Theoretical and practical considerations concerning the use of eye movement data are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Subjects read passages of text which differed in the extent to which the context constrained or predicted the occurrence of particular target words. In Experiment 1, misspellings were introduced into target words and we examined the extent to which fixation duration and probability of fixating the target word was influenced by contextual constraint and the misspelling. Subjects had a lower probability of fixating the target word in the high-constraint passages than in the low-constraint passages. Furthermore, when subjects did fixate the target, the fixation duration was shorter in the high-constraint passages. In Experiment 2, subjects read passages which included either a predictable target word or a visually similar word which was unpredictable. Fixation durations on the target word were shorter when the predictable word was in the target location than when the unpredictable word was present. The implications of the results for the role of contextual constraint in reading are discussed.},

	Abstract = {When electroencephalograms (EEGs) are averaged at eye fixation pauses (at the end of saccades), the specific brain potentials related to the visual information processing can be obtained. This eye-fixation-related potential (EFRP) is a type of event-related potential. In this paper, the authors introduced two systems developed at their laboratory. The first measured the distribution of EFRPs on the scalp with DC amplifiers in order to nullify eye movement artifacts. Three-dimensional EFRP topographies were obtained. The most prominent component (lambda response) of the waveform appeared at occipital sites. The second system was designed to examine the variation in EFRPs over time, using a sliding average method. The dynamic variation in EFRPs could be observed as an animation. The sequence of variations in amplitude was continuously displayed on a screen. This indicated the process of decrease and recovery of the lambda response generated by changes between periods of brightness and darkness. {$[$}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR{$]$}; Copyright of Japanese Psychological Research is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	Abstract = {According to the E-Z Reader model of eye-movement control, the completion of an early stage of lexical processing, the familiarity check, causes the eyes to move forward during reading (Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998). Here, we report an event-related potential (ERP) experiment designed to examine the hypothesized familiarity check at the electrophysiological level. The results indicate ERP components modulated by word frequency at the time of the predicted familiarity check. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that an early stage of lexical processing is linked to the "decisions" about when to move the eyes during reading.},

@article{Dimigen:2011,
	Abstract = {Brain-electric correlates of reading have traditionally been studied with word-by-word presentation, a condition that eliminates important aspects of the normal reading process and precludes direct comparisons between neural activity and oculomotor behavior. In the present study, we investigated effects of word predictability on eye movements (EM) and fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) during natural sentence reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and EM (via video-based eye tracking) were recorded simultaneously while subjects read heterogeneous German sentences, moving their eyes freely over the text. FRPs were time-locked to first-pass reading fixations and analyzed according to the cloze probability of the currently fixated word. We replicated robust effects of word predictability on EMs and the N400 component in FRPs. The data were then used to model the relation among fixation duration, gaze duration, and N400 amplitude, and to trace the time course of EEG effects relative to effects in EM behavior. In an extended Methodological Discussion section, we review 4 technical and data-analytical problems that need to be addressed when FRPs are recorded in free-viewing situations (such as reading, visual search, or scene perception) and propose solutions. Results suggest that EEG recordings during normal vision are feasible and useful to consolidate findings from EEG and eye-tracking studies.},

	Abstract = {Using concurrent electroencephalogram and eye movement measures to track natural reading, this study shows that N400 effects reflecting predictability are dissociable from those owing to spreading activation. In comparing predicted sentence endings with related and unrelated unpredicted endings in antonym constructions ('the opposite of black is white/yellow/nice'), fixation-related potentials at the critical word revealed a predictability-based N400 effect (unpredicted vs. predicted words). By contrast, event-related potentials time locked to the last fixation before the critical word showed an N400 only for the nonrelated unpredicted condition (nice). This effect is attributed to a parafoveal mismatch between the critical word and preactivated lexical features (i.e. features of the predicted word and its associates). In addition to providing the first demonstration of a parafoveally induced N400 effect, our results support the view that the N400 is best viewed as a component family.},

	Abstract = {We examined relations between eye movements (single-fixation durations) and RSVP-based event-related potentials (ERPs; N400s) recorded during reading the same sentences in two independent experiments. Longer fixation durations correlated with larger N400 amplitudes. Word frequency and predictability of the fixated word as well as the predictability of the upcoming word accounted for this covariance in a path-analytic model. Moreover, larger N400 amplitudes entailed longer fixation durations on the next word, a relation accounted for by word frequency. This pattern offers a neurophysiological correlate for the lag-word frequency effect on fixation durations: word processing is reliably expressed not only in fixation durations on currently fixated words, but also in those on subsequently fixated words.},

@article{Kliegl:2012,
	Abstract = {The development of theories and computational models of reading requires an understanding of processing constraints, in particular of timelines related to word recognition and oculomotor control. Timelines of word recognition are usually determined with event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded under conditions of serial visual presentation (SVP) of words; timelines of oculomotor control are derived from parameters of eye movements (EMs) during natural reading. We describe two strategies to integrate these approaches. One is to collect ERPs and EMs in separate SVP and natural reading experiments for the same experimental material (but different subjects). The other strategy is to co-register EMs and ERPs during natural reading from the same subjects. Both strategies yield data that allow us to determine how lexical properties influence ERPs (e.g., the N400 component) and EMs (e.g., fixation durations) across neighboring words. We review our recent research on the effects of frequency and predictability of words on both EM and ERP measures with reference to current models of eye-movement control during reading. Results are in support of the proposition that lexical access is distributed across several fixations and across brain-electric potentials measured on neighboring words.},

Two on-line methodologies, eye movements and event-related potentials, stand out in the search for the holy grail - an absolute time measure of when, how and why we recognize visual words while reading. Although each technique has its own experimental limitations, we suggest, by means of review and comparison, that these two methodologies can be used in complementary ways to produce a better picture of the mental action we call reading.},

@article{Hoedemaker:2014,
	Abstract = {Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted in which the manual response mode typically used in lexical decision tasks (LDTs) was replaced with an eye-movement response through a sequence of 3 words. This ocular LDT combines the explicit control of task goals found in LDTs with the highly practiced ocular response used in reading text. In Experiment 1, forward saccades indicated an affirmative lexical decision (LD) on each word in the triplet. In Experiment 2, LD responses were delayed until all 3 letter strings had been read. The goal of the study was to evaluate the contribution of task goals and response mode to semantic priming. Semantic priming is very robust in tasks that involve recognition of words in isolation, such as LDT, but limited during text reading, as measured using eye movements. Gaze durations in both experiments showed robust semantic priming even though ocular response times were much shorter than manual LDs for the same words in the English Lexicon Project. Ex-Gaussian distribution fits revealed that the priming effect was concentrated in estimates of tau (τ), meaning that priming was most pronounced in the slow tail of the distribution. This pattern shows differential use of the prime information, which may be more heavily recruited in cases in which the LD is difficult, as indicated by longer response times. Compared with the manual LD responses, ocular LDs provide a more sensitive measure of this task-related influence on word recognition as measured by the LDT.
