# Data Organization

This is a directory that one should either download the dataset to or alias the dataset to.

The scripts rely on a defined file structure where the data are organized under the main project folder.

To alias the dataset here, use the following command:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/dataset/ds002312 ./data/OcularLDT
```
